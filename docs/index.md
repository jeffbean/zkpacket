# ZKPacket

## Summary
Zookeeper Packet (ZKPacket) has a goal to be a low overhead packet sniffer to collect high fidelity metrics and logs on a particular Zookeeper service. Operating Zookeeper is not a small cost for any team and one issue in this space is the lack of higher fidelity metrics in the Zookeeper program itself.
